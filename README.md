This is a virtual bookshelf web application. You can create your account and start registering your books.

Some key features are:

- Functional application with ReactJS.
- Front-end state management done with Redux and Redux Saga.
- Authentication system made with JWT.
- UI built with Styled Components and React Icons.
- Light and Dark theme.
- Forms optimized and validated by Unform and Yup.
- Custom alerts with React Toastify and React Laag.
- Avatar upload for your user and your book covers.
- Type checking using PropTypes.
- List animation with Framer Motion.
- Local debugging connected with Reactotron.

The application is built using ReactJS and Redux. Data is provided by a proprietary
API, in this [repository](https://github.com/areasflavio/bookshelf-manager-server).
The user interface is built with Styled Components. The entire codebase is written
using Javascript.
